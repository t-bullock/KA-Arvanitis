# KA Arvanitis

KA Arvanitis is a typeface imitating the style of neumes in Ioannis Arvanitisâ€™ Akathist book (Athens, 1997).

This font is designed for typing Byzantine Music Scores using the program [Kassia](https://github.com/t-bullock/Kassia), but can be used in any word processor or text editor.
